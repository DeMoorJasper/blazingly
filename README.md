# Blazingly (Proof Of Concept/Experiment)

Blazinglyâ„¢ is a SSR cli tool using parcel in the background for creating web projects that load insanely fast without having to worry about anything as a developer, thanks to the power of parcel and the many tools already included within this CLI.

## What makes it so Blazing?

Blazingly uses parcel which causes insanely fast rebuilds during development.
Besides using Parcel, Blazingly also optimises your web project in other ways using plugins/presets designed specifically for blazingly to utilise performance best practises as much as it can.

- Usage of service workers right from the get-go
- Lazy loading all js and css files
- Extracting critical css when building

## Sounds awesome! How does it work?
